Welcome to Trakio!

Once in the correct directory, use the command "make build" to compile the 
program. This will check the types in the database file accordingly. 

When testing the functions in database.ml, use the created file "issues.txt" 
as the file containing tasks.

To test interactively, use the command "make" to launch utop. To use the current,
under development, database functions use Database.xxx

(OPAM - depending on if i can make the tables, they MAY need to do 
"opam install fmt" in terminal. this depends how far i get rn - natasha)

In order to run the UI, please run "make start". 
(You can also run it through utop using "make" and then run #use "main.ml".) 

A test user you may use is with the login "Natasha" and password "passwordlol". 
This will allow you to see how a user's (Natasha's) tasks are printed. 
The usernames and passwords are currently stored in "login_details.txt" but 
the only one connected to a user in the "issues.txt" file is "Natasha". 

You may also test out creating a user by typing "create" instead 
of "Natasha" when first running main, but this is not yet implemented and will
just verify if the username and password you've entered are legal.

To run the test suite run make test.
