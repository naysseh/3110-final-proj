Welcome to Trackio!

Once in the correct directory, use the command "make build" to compile the 
program. This will check the types in the database file accordingly. 

When testing the functions in database.ml, use the created file "issues.txt" 
as the file containing tasks, or "teams.txt" as the file containing teams.
