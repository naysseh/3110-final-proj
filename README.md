# 3110-final-proj
CS 3110 final project for ai93, nca28, bas339

Early project ideas: 
* Program that tells you whether another arbitrary program will terminate, or continue to run forever
* Service that extracts money from the stock market and makes us all rich

ai93:
* we're doing the final project using the agile framework so i think creating a tool for the agile framework would be kinda cool
