# 3110-final-proj
CS 3110 final project for ai93, nca28, bas339

Early project ideas: 
* A synthesizer that you can play with your keyboard
* Audio frequency spectrum analyzer
* Implement the Perceptron in OCaml
* Painting software, think Tux Paint
* Malware (potentially fun to make, but morally reprehensible)
* A python interpreter (this seems really hard so idk)
* French-to-English translator
* iPhone jailbreak software (this is mega advanced I just think it's cool to think about)
* Online election system! (y'all better be voting btw)
* Implement a blockchain system of some sort (As much as I hate blockchain)
* Pattern recognition system (text or images, we can try to recognize objects or sentiments)
* Steganography or encryption

ai93:
* we're doing the final project using the agile framework so i think creating a tool for the agile framework would be kinda cool
